### Game Mechanics Prototypes
This is a repo dedicated to experiment and test different ideas and mechanics for games using TypeScript. This is a playground to explore new concepts, implement prototypes and validate ideas.

## ðŸŽ® Objective
This repo serves as a testing field for:

Develop game mechanics or reproduce classic concepts.
Test integration with tecnologies like Canvas 2D, WebGL, audio libraries, etc.
Explore gameplay ideas, physics, input controls, VFX, and more.
Document the process of prototyping for future reference.

Every prototype is independent and focus in a single mechanic or specific concept (can be more than one sometimes), allowing for experimentation without compromise with a bigger project or schedules.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
The repo is organized like this:

game-mechanics-prototypes/
â”œâ”€â”€ prototype-01/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts
    â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ prototype-02/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ (sprites, sounds, etc.)
â””â”€â”€ ...

prototype-XX/: Every directory have its own independent script and a README file explaining the game mechanic.
assets/: Shared resources, like sprites or sound files.
